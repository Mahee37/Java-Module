Hybrid inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from multiple classes, combining both single and multiple inheritance. In hybrid inheritance, a class can inherit from multiple base classes using a combination of single inheritance and multiple inheritance.
In single inheritance, a class can inherit from only one base class, whereas in multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from more than one base class. Hybrid inheritance combines these two types of inheritance to provide greater flexibility in creating class hierarchies.With hybrid inheritance, a derived class can inherit properties and methods from a single base class and also inherit from multiple base classes. This allows the derived class to reuse code from different classes and benefit from the features provided by each of the base classes.
However, hybrid inheritance can be complex and can lead to certain issues such as the diamond problem, where ambiguity arises when a derived class inherits from two or more classes that have a common base class. To handle such situations, programming languages may provide mechanisms like virtual inheritance or method overriding to resolve conflicts.
It's worth noting that not all programming languages support hybrid inheritance directly. Some languages, like C++, provide support for multiple inheritance, which can be used to achieve hybrid inheritance by carefully designing class hierarchies. Other languages, like Java, only support single inheritance, which limits the direct use of hybrid inheritance.
#Java Code
// Base class
class Animal {
  void eat() {
    System.out.println("The animal is eating.");
  }
}

// Another base class
interface Jumpable {
  void jump();
}

// Derived class inheriting from Animal and implementing Jumpable interface
class Kangaroo extends Animal implements Jumpable {
  void display() {
    System.out.println("Kangaroo class");
  }

  @Override
  public void jump() {
    System.out.println("The kangaroo is jumping.");
  }
}

// Another derived class inheriting from Kangaroo
class BabyKangaroo extends Kangaroo {
  void display() {
    System.out.println("BabyKangaroo class");
  }

  void sleep() {
    System.out.println("The baby kangaroo is sleeping.");
  }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    BabyKangaroo babyKangaroo = new BabyKangaroo();
    babyKangaroo.display();
    babyKangaroo.eat();
    babyKangaroo.jump();
    babyKangaroo.sleep();
  }
}
In the example above, we have three classes: Animal, Jumpable, Kangaroo, and BabyKangaroo.

The Animal class is a base class with a method eat(). The Jumpable interface declares a method jump(). The Kangaroo class inherits from the Animal class using single inheritance and implements the Jumpable interface. It overrides the jump() method.

The BabyKangaroo class then inherits from the Kangaroo class using single inheritance. It has its own method display() and sleep(). Since it extends Kangaroo, it also inherits the eat() method from the Animal class and implements the jump() method from the Jumpable interface.

In the main() method, we create an instance of BabyKangaroo and call its methods to demonstrate the usage of hybrid inheritance.
