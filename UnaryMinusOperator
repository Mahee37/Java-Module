The unary minus operator - is a built-in operator in Java used for negating a numeric value. It is a unary operator because it operates on a single operand.

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of the unary minus operator in Java:

java
Copy code
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int result = -x;

        System.out.println("Original value: " + x);
        System.out.println("Negated value: " + result);
    }
}
In this code, the variable x is assigned the value 10. The unary minus operator - is then used to negate the value of x and store it in the variable result. Finally, the original value of x and the negated value result are printed to the console. The output will be:

yaml
Copy code
Original value: 10
Negated value: -10
As you can see, the unary minus operator negates the value of x, changing it from 10 to -10.
