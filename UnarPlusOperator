The unary plus operator + is another built-in operator in Java. It is a unary operator that doesn't change the sign of the operand; it is essentially a no-op.

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of the unary plus operator in Java:

java
Copy code
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int result = +x;

        System.out.println("Original value: " + x);
        System.out.println("Unary plus value: " + result);
    }
}
In this code, the variable x is assigned the value 10. The unary plus operator + is then used to apply no operation to the value of x and store it in the variable result. Finally, the original value of x and the value after applying the unary plus operator result are printed to the console. The output will be:

yaml
Copy code
Original value: 10
Unary plus value: 10
As you can see, the unary plus operator doesn't change the value of x; it remains 10.
