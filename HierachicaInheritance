In Java, hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class extends multiple subclasses, creating a hierarchy or tree-like structure. It allows a class to inherit properties and methods from a single superclass while acting as a superclass for multiple subclasses.

Here's an example to illustrate hierarchical inheritance in Java:
#java Code
class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("The animal is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog is barking.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    public void meow() {
        System.out.println("The cat is meowing.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();  // inherited from Animal class
        dog.bark(); // specific to Dog class

        Cat cat = new Cat();
        cat.eat();  // inherited from Animal class
        cat.meow(); // specific to Cat class
    }
}
